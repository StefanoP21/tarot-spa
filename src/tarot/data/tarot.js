On the figure's back is a bone-like design, slightly emulating typical skeletal structure until the shoulders and arms are noticed, whereupon the viewer realizes that the bone designs form the shape and form of scales, such as in the idea of the scales of justice, with the scale plates being skulls.

At the feet of the primary figure lies a second, unconscious person. Where the classical depiction has the angel pouring liquid between two cups, here the two figures themselves are the vessels: a tube is strapped to the right arms of both figures, connecting their bloodstreams. The mixing of liquid has been interpreted variously as the dilution of wine with water, the harmony of the psychic and the material, or the flow of time between past and future. Additional tubing runs to the clenched jaw of the primary figure, then to various piping in the background.",
